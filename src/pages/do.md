# What we do

## About EA Philadelphia
EA Philadelphia is a community of do-gooders who care deeply about the world and are interested in making helping others a significant part of their lives.

Many of our members support high impact charitable causes through giving pledges such as Giving What We Can and One for the World based on recommendations from charity evaluators like GiveWell, The Open Philanthropy Project, and Animal Charity Evaluators. Some are researchers or other professionals doing high impact work over a vast range of topics including but not limited to global poverty, biosecurity, animal welfare, policy reform, mental health & wellbeing, and global catastrophic risks such as nuclear war, artificial intelligence, and climate change. Others are moral philosophers, economists, social entrepreneurs, and students.

## Our Team
EA Philadelphia is led by a team of volunteers who are passionate about doing good better.  We strive to create a thriving EA community by hosting socials, workshops, speaker events, and other activities for do-gooders in the greater Philadelphia area.

EA group organizers are an integral component of the effective altruism community and play a central role in helping the movement achieve many of its aims such as: directing funds to high impact causes, influencing career trajectories, and advancing the community's intellectual progress. If you’d like to become involved in this work, we’d love to have you on the team!
